 - Q: Isn't this allowing test-oriented logic to leak into my application?

   A: Think of it as sort of like [ember-test-selectors](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors) for your async code.

 - Q: Isn't this providing a tool to completely cross-cut all the normal architectural boundaries we rely on to keep our code from devolving into a mess of spaghetti?

   A: Yep! But only for testing/development purposes, and in a fairly controlled way. Use your best judgment. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
